# Gussing Game


### The general idea
This is a simple guessing game using the Assembly language. The user guesses a number from 1: 255 On each attempt, a message appears to help him reach the correct number. 
Every time we tell him whether the number that was guessed is smaller or larger than the correct number, and this is via messages:                                                                                    - Number is Less  ,                       
-Number is More                                                                                                                                                                                                        OR  -Number out of range!.                                                                 
If he guesses the number correctly, we congratulate him with the message: 'Oh! You guessed right this time'  Then we give him a choice if he wants to try it again, or he closes the program 'Retry ? [y/n] ' if he chooses 'n', then pressing any button will close the program. But if he chooses 'y', here another message appears to him 'Do you want to guess a new number ? [y/n] ', which is a choice if he wants to try with a new number or with the same numbers he tried before. If he chooses 'n'  he will play with the same numbers used before, If he chooses 'y' he will play with a new number.                                                  This program contains only 4 different numbers for guessing. If the user guesses them all correctly and wants to play again, then a number of them is played randomly.
